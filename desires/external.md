# I would like to have...

* All debts paid off
* All upgrades/repairs completed on my home
* My physical waste reduced by at least 70-90%
* Instruction on how to patch/mend clothing like my sister does and the capacity to use these abilities when I need to
* Money to financially support the small-time, remarkable artists/creators (e.g. Vintage & Morelli, Trevor Gieske, etc)
* An iterated custom design of my Nomatic backpack
* A practice of letting go of complex ideas by instead making whitepapers outlining the idea
* A way to release unproductive and cynical thoughts
* A completed digital workshop to pump out non-whitepaper'd ideas in my idea repository
* Adherence to ../authenticity/content_creation.md
