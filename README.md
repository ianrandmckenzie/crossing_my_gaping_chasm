# Crossing My Gaping Chasm

## The ladder end of my self-care journey turned open source

Supporting Documents for a Miro Board outlining my path forward in life. I think I have a (possibly sick) fascination with finding out what happens by making my future actions completely transparent to the general public. This assumes that I may eventually become 'relevant' enough for it to even matter to anyone.

Anyway, here's the Miro Board public link:

"Crossing My Gaping Chasm" is the idea that creating a successful, profitable business cannot truly exist in harmony in our world if you do not first sort yourself out. And yet, even though that makes sense on the surface, reconciling who you truly are may be at odds with creating a successful business. Many people in this world who are partners, gatekeepers, adversaries, etc. have not sorted themselves out.

It is easy to make pragmatic, sacrificial choices in the face of this. It is my philosophy that to do so simply perpetuates the stifling of social and emotional progress. This is my attempt to navigate a truly healthy business leader in harmony with a truly healthy business.
