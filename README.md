# Crossing My Gaping Chasm

Supporting Documents for a Miro Board I may eventually make public.

"Crossing My Gaping Chasm" is the idea that creating a successful, profitable business cannot truly exist in harmony in our world if you do not first sort yourself out first. And yet, even though that makes sense on the surface, reconciling who you truly are may be at odds with creating a business. Many people in this world who are partners, gatekeepers, adversaries, etc. have not sorted themselves out.

It is easy to make pragmatic, sacrificial choices in the face of this. It is my philosophy that to do so simply perpetuates the stifling social and emotional progress. This is my attempt to navigate a truly healthy business leader in harmony with a truly healthy business.
