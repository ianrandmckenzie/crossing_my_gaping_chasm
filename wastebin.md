## A Place to Release Unhelpful/Cynical Thoughts

When are we going to admit that the 'photo of white guy wearing sunglasses and a pristine linen polo looking at the sunset while on a sailboat' is the façade of success with immense human suffering behind it once peeled off the wall?

If an AI truly wanted to eliminate humans, it would succeed. Anyone who thinks otherwise is and always has lived their lives in a childlike fantasy.

Re French Revolution guillotines: The French oppressors may no longer exist, but oppressors still exist today — even with the blade of Damocles looming over their transgressions. If the rich are dogs, perhaps we need to engineer positive reinforcement instead? Ask any trainer. They know.

The difference between a successful high performer and a low performer isn't by speeding up all the time through brute force, it's by speeding up when it matters most. Life is a marathon with the occasional race.

Yelling at the barista for taking too long is the trait of a brute force performer on the path to burn out. All the while, they could have quietly waited for the barista finish, regardless of how long they take — while they take in the beauty of your mundane surroundings as they connect the dots of their future.

Freedom lovers help when someone asks them. Authoritarians help when no one asked.

'Financial literacy' is doublespeak for the powerful obfuscating value, socially engineering short-term financial decision making & overall market/consumer manipulation

Sure, teach financial literacy, but there will always be a narrative of: "It's your fault you're in poverty."

---

Debating about superficial problems is easier than facing real ones.

A Note to Trolls & Scammers: There's plenty of fish in the sea, and I am an unidentified bottom-feeding crustacean, stop using so many sinkers on your hook & line.

Everybody's an altruist until a stranger sets up a tent in their front yard.

---

Why start a crypto pump and dump scheme when you could simply become a nationally elected official and trade stocks prior to legislation being announced/passed?

---

Social media has indoctrinated us into believing our opinions matter – the more controversial, the more attention we get. Being actively toxic toward civil discourse is now a widely accepted and profitable pastime.

2020: The United States' national debt = $29 Trillion. Then I found this article about financial bailouts a while back (2008). Also $29 Trillion. If you divided that by 330 million (roughly the population of USA), EACH American paid these banks $87,000.

Today I used @project_wren's carbon footprint calculator, and 50% of my carbon footprint is my freelance technology business. I'm curious how much of everyone's carbon emissions are because of their job? The calculator seems to be about the individual separate from their job.

After watching a president of an international superpower throw tantrums on the daily for 4 years, I can no longer be convinced we are not all children looking for love and safety. The only difference is we stop being cute and start being more of a threat to ourselves and others.

As someone who is extremely skilled in cobbling together cheap hardware with free open-source software in a gimmicky way, I am really impressed with Qux's initiative to swindle alt-right people into overpaying for a false sense of security!

Did you know that I am perfect in every single way possible? The only times I show imperfection is when it's the punchline to a joke that I am making. Now, if I may, I'd like to present to you my most ambitious comedic punchline: MY ENTIRE LIFE

*badum tss*

I wonder if the internet would have as many arguments if we used empathy, understanding of intention, context, and nuance before using judgment?

---

My biggest lesson as an entrepreneur / businessowner: It's all fun and games until people's livelihoods are on the line.

---

I know it's pretty cringing to think/say that straight white men are also victims of white supremacist patriarchy (obviously to a much lesser degree). Yet, if we openly admitted this more often, perhaps a lot of us would stop defending and perpetuating it so much?

---

The best way to acquire allies is through a common enemy. Measured pragmatism, empathy, and shared suffering can go a long way.

---

We all know comparing our own success with others is extremely unhealthy. Perhaps our lack of success/suffering shouldn't be determining our pecking order in the fight against systematic oppression?

---

A summary of learning feminism (last 3 months):

Real feminist: "I don't have anything against men, I am against the system of oppression that uses men to oppress everyone."

Strawman feminist: "If the patriarchy isn't real, why is there a Peyton Manning, but no Peyton Womanning??"

---

For those seeking solitude, adversity is a reliable companion.

As someone who has held office as a Republican, I know we as a party have come a long way – and not for the better. Most people under the age of 25 that I meet do not know the difference between conservatism and authoritarianism.

---

Poetically written definition of codependency: My heart is like my fist. It beats harder when you're near.

---

I've given up asking for help

All I do is stare blankly

Ceaselessly picking my scalp

It is what it is, quite frankly

---

“No-nonsense” economics pundit host in a nutshell: "It’s a simple question! Will these stocks go up or down, Mr. Guest, yes or no?!"

---

I find it ironic saying hateful words is being 'politically incorrect' even though the majority of political systems are structured to perpetuate the oppression of marginalized groups. If you ask me, saying something like the 'n-word' is as politically correct as you can get when you peel back all of your masked indoctrination.

---

Sex is great & all, but have you argued w/ 17 strangers over 6 hours ending in failing to convince anyone, further entrenching you & your adversaries in ultimately benign opinions even though you were just taking 2min to check if the Pinterest recipe said 1 pinch of salt, or 2?

---

My online friends always used to say, 'fuck bitches, get money' – I thought they were just trying to sound masculine, but in retrospect, I think I may have unknowingly been in an incel community.

---

Art projects are like opinions, they matter so dearly to you, but if you hold on to too many of them, they will completely shut you down and make you dysfunctional 24/7.

---

As a programmer, doing the same thing and expecting a different result isn't insanity, it's a debugging skill.  As a spiritual person, the true definition of insanity is thinking you can control people, control physics, or control anything you cannot.

I still don't understand the dark roast coffee fad here in Canada. When coffee beans are roasted to the point of becoming charcoal, they lose all their flavour, and their caffeine. A mouthful of dirt and rubber flavours all while not getting my morning jolt awake? Why?
