## Leviathans of Human Social Dynamics
1. Spiritual - God, Religion, etc. —> Interfacing with the unknown
2. State - Law, governance, etc. —> Interfacing with resource coordination (labor, value store [money], etc.)
3. Network - Cultural values, community, etc. —> Interfacing with people of specific values

### What are potentially the next leviathans? What are unacknowledged leviathans?
* Culture
* Emotion
* Optimism / Pessimism

### What are some of the most powerful experiences in life?
* As we already know, God, storing value, and communities for specific shared experiences
* Emotion (experiencing it, managing it, communicating it)
* How does one create a system of ideal emotional management at a scalable, social level?
