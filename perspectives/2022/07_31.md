New medium ➝ Consensus concludes New medium as 'the' medium ➝ Medium becomes the message ➝ That's okay until it's not ➝ Repeat

### New medium ➝
* (Pharmaceuticals > Bloodletting, Homeopathy, other silly old-timey stuff)
* (Capitalist economics > oligarchic economics)
* (Social media > traditional media)
### Consensus concludes New medium as 'the' medium ➝
* Pharmaceuticals heal people better than everything else
* Capitalism brings prosperity better than anything else
* Social media brings equality to voice and entertainment better than anything else
### Medium becomes the message ➝
* Well all accept these things because of their value
### That's okay until it's not ➝
* Pharmaceuticals begin to have a problem of "the remedy is worse than the disease"
* Capitalism gets too de-regulated and exploits workers to a tipping point
* Social media algorithms begins to suppress voices more than they used to amplify them
* ➝ In essence, the solution becomes the problem
### Repeat
* When things aren't okay, people are driven to change the system
*
