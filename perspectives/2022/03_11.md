## Renewal / Rebirth
* I am a child. I need to grow myself.
* Adopt a routine
* Be thrifty with playtime - time cost is as unaffordable as money cost
* Nourish your growing (body/mind now matured, now it's time for maturing value stores)
  * Set a goal or quota?: $xxx/day
* Before doing something that makes you feel safe, consider how long that feeling of safety will last, and if it's worth the time
