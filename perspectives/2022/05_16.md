### Self-sovereign Identity (my view)
* Full control of your data
* Unauthorized storage of a person's data, whether anonymized or not, is illegal
* Failure to remove storage of a person's data, whether anonymized or not, is illegal
* Failure to comply with a person's revocation of the storage of their data, whether anonymized or not, is illegal
* Companies, nor governments, or any other entity are exempt from these rules
* Company's may not store the person's SSI UUID prior to authorization or after revocation
* Governments may only store the person's SSI UUID paired with their national unique identifier (such as SSN in USA)
* A separate database (with backups) of existing IDs must be kept so that in an event of a restoration occurring, the separate ID database can be compared with IDs and their associated data that should not exist
* Failure to comply with these rules at a national level is a human rights violation
