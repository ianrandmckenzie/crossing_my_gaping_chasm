# Layer 2 Web
```
Status: Open

Chrome extension (PC) and mobile app that injects paywalled content independently of the platform itself.

* YouTube, Twitter, etc.
  * "Super Follow" on Twitter, "Subscribe" on YouTube, authenticated via NFT auth
  * Native app with web view where content is injected through XSS
* XSS is normally an attack vector, but it's only hacking if the user doesn't consent to the injection

## Questions
* How is restricted content distributed in NFT community currently?
* Start with discovery â€” find a community that wants to produce content in a native app. Does that community exist?
* Look into Farcaster, Web3 Twitter - is this a redundant idea?
* Look into beb.xyz
* Look into paragraph.xyz
