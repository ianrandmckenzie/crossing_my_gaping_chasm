# Pinterest Extension
```
Status: Open
```
A Google Chrome extension that:
* Filters for only posts from a certain gender identity 
* Filters to see from another races eyes as well

The idea being that you can see a topic from a certain groups eyes.

This idea came from when I signed up to Pinterest back in 2015 as I was trying to develop a better sense of style with the way I dress. Several years later, I attempted to use Pinterest again, but the men's fashion search had completely transformed.

I concluded that back when I was first using it, I got value from the passive fashion advice I got from scrolling because I was able to see what women wanted to see in a man's dress. At the time, I wanted to dress in a way that was attractive to women, not to myself.

I wanted to refine my sense of style so that I can continue to dress in a way that my partner would appreciate and find attractive. But, the feeds had been taken over by a man's sense of fashion and what men find attractive in other men. Not necessarily because they are gay, but because they are seeing through their own male eyes, not female eyes.
