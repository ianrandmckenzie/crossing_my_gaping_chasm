# The Game is Rigged
```
Status: Open
```
## Board Game or Web Board Game
Players have rigged dice and everyone has to figure out who is who. E.g. billionaire, disabled, average, minority, etc

At intervals in the game: Opportunity! Roll the dice to see who wins.

In between opportunities, players chat with each other to learn:

* Where are you from?
* How is your health?
* Do you have any past trauma?
* Would you kill or risk your life to show your support for [authoritarian's] views?
* etc

At the end of the game, everyone guesses who is who. The person with the most correct guesses wins. In a tie, the person who got guessed correctly less than their tie wins. In a rare 2-layer tie, the one with greater status wins (e.g. average beats disabled).
