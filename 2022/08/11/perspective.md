## The Next 'Leviathan'
[The Network State asserts that 'Network' has emerged as the third 'leviathan' of power/authority in our society.](https://thenetworkstate.com/god-state-network)

The Network State is a proposed solution to our current cascading failure of institutions â€” a holistic approach to unifying or balancing the three 'leviathans' (God, State, and Network).

How soon will a fourth leviathan emerge? Will the future find harmony between all four?

Better yet, will our society find harmony by all three currently known leviathans?
