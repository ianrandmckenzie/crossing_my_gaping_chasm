## ~~Justice~~ Forgiveness

* "Pharmaceuticals ravaged my body and held me back for decades." — Forgive
* "[redacted name] stiffed me $5k" — Forgive
* "[redacted name] said some really fucked up stuff and never apologized, even when it was right in front of their years later." — Forgive
* "[redacted name] stole shit from me and was cruel to me with [redacted name]." — Forgive
* "[redacted name] ignored me when I was 3-years old and badly scraped my knee, despite crying way longer than I even needed to." — Forgive
* "The wealthy ignore the atrocities they commit and delude/justify themselves by laundering spilled blood with philanthropy." — Forgive
* "I never let myself be honest about a lot of the above to myself or anyone else" — Forgive
