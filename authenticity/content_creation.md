# Pre-Production & Pre-Publish Checklist

* Title/Thumb is 50% of entire project
  * Leaves an intriguing question/thought unanswered
* Title is <50 characters
* Thumbnail and title must ALWAYS be authentic to the content, regardless of clickbait levels
* Thumbnail must primarily feature imagery from the content
* It's about serving your audience, because your act of service is ultimately what serves you as well!
  * You are talking about THEM
  * You are talking TO THEM
  * You are solving THEIR problems
  * You are getting THEM excited
  * You are making THEM happy
* Hack - before 30s mark, exclaim, "It was at that point that I lost my fucking mind!"
* Come out swinging (first 30s): popping text captions (for video)
* They say for video, be yourself times two (You, x2) â€” I reject this notion and instead pose that I should be passionate enough about the content that it propels me into being x2 or even x3+ naturally.
* Make calls-to-action as it relates to self-promo <=3 seconds
