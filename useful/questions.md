## The Big Question
```
How do I ally myself meaningful stakeholders in my future by making the below message about how *they* will benefit from what I am capable of?
```
I have found a way to live with schizophrenia without medication, regular psychiatry visits, or any other care outside of what I provide for myself and I am now healthier than most 'abled' people. Since fully coming off pharmaceuticals, my mind has expanded tenfold in the last year alone. I am now setting my sights on fixing the cause of 'evil' in humanity.

I am as productive and efficient as a team of 5 or more because the majority of expense in a company is time spent on meetings to coordinate. After that, I keep myself efficient by saying 'good enough' at 80% quality, because the 2nd biggest expense is workers wasting time chasing that last 20%.

I know this because I started a rapidly growing digital agency of highly talented, capable, and motivated people and I do not make my statements as a disparagement to them — I love them dearly and I still have remorse for shutting my business down in the face of their unwavering dedication.

I have also been living, for the most part (95%), the material life I desire on less than $15k/yr. $400k is far more than I need to bring me the stability I need for the 12-36 months I need to build, market, and scale any of the projects I listed previously.

In short, I am in the top 0.01% in the world at making big things happen completely solo. I have tried to get employment, tried to stay in employment, tried to be an employer — I simply cannot sustain any of these in order to properly manage my schizophrenia. All I need is time and money to pay the bills during that time. After that, mountains will be moved.
