# Useful Observations About Myself

* I seem to dive right into work if I open my laptop and my task is literally right in front of me
* Hearing the loud, intentional breathing out from people helps to ground me in contemplative moments
* Over time, my ability to do anything is crippled by a day-to-day that is dominated by seemingly purposeless tasks
* It seems the only way to truly be creatively free is the willingness to mourn and let go of dead projects
* In terms of communication, phone is best. In terms of reliably reaching me, email is best. So, I would say call first and then email if I don't answer.
* Having my project workspace open and waiting for me when I start my day helps guarantee success for the day
* Accepting money always causes problems for me when any of these questions have the answer of 'no':
  * Is this true to me?
  * Am I awake?
  * Will my work be absent of causing harm (known or unknown)?
* Poetry is a vehicle for releasing cynical thoughts in a way that doesn't feel as gross as more explicit communication
