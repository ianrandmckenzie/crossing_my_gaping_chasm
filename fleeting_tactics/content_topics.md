BTC and other decentralization is a sheep in wolf's clothing - it turns the wolves into sheep so that we are all guided by our Shepherd instead.

Liberating scaled systems of comms (social media/journalism) from ad model.

Think like a marketer: if they resist, move on. “I guess it’s not for you, that’s okay.”

You hear what you want to hear you don’t hear what you don’t want to hear -> Brittany breathing and schizophrenia brain vs normal brain.

Be kind and loving in social media (rebellion against fear)
* Example (in response to a chart from a misinformation campaign that provides insufficient information — aka a masked narrative through obfuscating statistics): "Wow, that's quite a revelation! I am shocked that [institutions] allowed this to happen. I want to find out more, but there is no link on the chart, and I don't quite understand if the chart is referring to this year or several years in the past. Can you send me the link?
* Example: "Misinformation sheeple are dumb" -> "Misinformation victims did not have the socioeconomic privilege to identify logical fallacies and how to verify credible sources"
* Example: "Don't lick your plate, honey, it's bad manners" -> "Bad manners are a synonym for mannerisms of people in a lower socioeconomic background, we do not want to look poor because we falsely believe wealthy people are superior"

The next iteration of “taking the power back” is through decentralized protocols. The internet brought new formats of media. Decentralization brings new distribution that cannot be mismanaged by centralized authorities.
* Mastodon already does this with socials. Why is hardly anyone on it? It isn’t growing like wildfire much like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok did. Why?

Innovators who want to defend those that share their suffering will always defeat those who defend those who seek to preserve the status quo that only defends themselves from suffering

Those with nothing to lose will always defeat those that have everything to lose. "Having everything" is only possible with centralized hoarding of wealth and power.

Make pulling the weeds a part of your daily routine.

In order to truly be able to serve, you must know:
* The world owes you nothing.
* You owe the world nothing.

True to me as I know it: Laughter, Anti-centralized authority/power, beauty (even if traditionally ugly)

The internet “took the power back” from institutional centralized authorities as it relates to the distribution of information.
* The problem, however, is that within two short decades, that power re-centralized to proprietary, corporate institutions that now create the same problems.

Grind culture -> Self-care hardliner

Centralized success -> Mediocrity maximalism

Wealth/Power = Complacency = Backwards, self-serving conservatism ::: Anti-complacency = Innovation

Is the problem that workers have been separated from the means of production?
* Or is it that the people with power to solve problems have been separated from the means of suffering?

"common sense" -> Uncommon sense

"use your brain" -> I don't use my brain, I use my heart

"Good manners" differentiates from indicators of poverty and unhealthy coping mechanisms (aka classism)

Competitive/successful people who are challenged on their thoughts further entrenches ones false knowledge -> Intentional mediocrity assists maintaining an open mind

Scarcity -> Fear -> Hoard Resources -> Creates scarcity for others -> Repeat ::: Scarcity -> Faith in others -> Generous with resources -> Creates safety and abundance for others -> Repeat
* *when making personal choices

Anger -> Retaliation/Justice -> Suffering -> Repeat ::: Anger -> Forgiveness (+ any necessary boundary setting) -> Healing -> New Ally
* *within reasonable limits, some are beyond redemption

Daily:
* Rebel against yourself
* Revolt against the systems that pit you and your communities against each other in service of the few

Faith that if you provide meaningful value to others, your safety and needs will be met, and that decentralized systems can empower that faith as well as make it transactionally simpler

Cannot trust: Repeated price fixing lawsuits (doesn't even take into account pending or unlitigated suits)

Institutions have failed us. What do they all have in common? Centralized authority controlled by workers separated from the means of suffering

For millennia, the world has been the powerful tripping over each other to bring their terrible vision to fruition, meanwhile, the will of the people are building an actual better future

Strong men -> Good times -> Complacency -> Weak men -> Bad times -> Impetus for meaningful change -> Good times -> Repeat
* How do we break the cycle? How do we raise the standard so that complacency is eradicated? The cycle is popular and easy to digest, but it doesn't tell us WHY it's so true.
* It will always be corrected because even its accepted rhetoric is deprived of any meaningful context

"Vote with your feet" makes votes vulnerable to physical coercion

Self-sovereign identity

Self-sovereign sociability

Self-sovereign mobility

Self-sovereign store of value

Legal: Automated and AI generated messages should indicate as much strongly in the visual hierarchy of the content

Parable: People screaming "end the fed" can do so all they like, but until there is a viable, easily adoptable replacement, it's throwing the baby out with the bathwater

Rehash some of the old Minecraft content (remove MC references from videos with general topics, e.g. masculinity, divinity, etc.)

Voice memo recordings

D&D vs Real Life = the same (parable):
* Today's politicians look like ghouls
* Manosphere gurus look like trickster goblins that protect the establishment/elite (dragons)
* The wealthy are dragons, hoarding mountains of gold
