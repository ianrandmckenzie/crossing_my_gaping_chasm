# SaaS Marketing
My aggregation of traditional/conventional SaaS marketing knowledge.

## Above All Else
* People don't buy something because it is advertised to them, they buy it because they want it
* People want to buy something if it is useful and fulfills an emotional need
* They justify fulfilling that emotional need with logic
* Many are proud of their purchase because it is one or more:
  * Makes them feel like an insider
    * Scarce (even more so if that scarcity is not contrived)
    * Luxurious
  * Signals their identity/aspirational identity
  * Creates or compounds social connections

## Doing the Research
* It's about people who believe in the vision and are excited about the product
* Sharing it authentically on Facebook Groups, Subreddits, Discords, etc. (Guerrilla marketing if applicable)
* Talking to as many as people as you can to get feedback
* What will people pay for? What is stopping them from signing up to it?
* What is it that will propel people to generate word of mouth marketing?
* Where do you end? A timeframe or a dollar value. (Roadmap/Exit strategy)

## Referrals
* Someone signs up to [the app]
  * They do a thing and want to show others or bring them in
    * Said others see the thing and are compelled to sign up as well
      * They bring one or more others to do the same.
* Holy Grail = k > 1 (viral)
* Which feature will do this best?
* Find every opportunity to convert
* Incentivize referrals
* Are there SEO opportunities with this space?
* When they [booked a meeting/made money/did a thing], prompt them to share on other platforms.
* Make a waitlist for new features.
* Give people who opt-in closed windows the ability to share exclusive features with their friends.
* Follow people from contacts list.
* Achievement system centered around sharing content, referrals, etc.
