# Publishing on Socials
Content strategy, how, what, where, how long, how many?

## Content Strategy
Long story short: Riffing with "Content Topics" as prompts, ensuring adherence to content structure, adherence to publishing strategy, and adherence to the 'is my content worth peoples time?' checklist.

Also: Self promo rule: 50/1 x5 then 5/1 after that.

## How (Not yet determined)
Publishing targets (via GDrive? Headliner? ClickUp Zaps? Custom coded app? Whatever it is, AUTOMATIC publishing! Once proper assets are put into place, of course — scheduling option required.)
