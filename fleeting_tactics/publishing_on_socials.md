# Publishing on Socials
Content strategy, structure, how, what, where, how long, how many?

## Content Strategy
Long story short: Riffing with "Content Topics" as prompts, ensuring adherence to content structure, adherence to publishing strategy, and adherence to the 'is my content worth peoples time?' checklist.

Also: Self promo rule: 50/1 x5 then 5/1 after that.

Giving our generous following/subscribing "rewards" (all channels) AKA communication roadmap (example):
* 10k
* 100k
* 1000k

## Content Structure
* Opening (hook) Today was REVOLTING!!! [explain why] (w/ popping subtitles)
  * Doesn't have to be exactly this, but something dramatic that instantly hooks
* Close with: We need you. Heal yourself. Do better.
* Self-promo closing: Ending with a topic about injustice that appears to make me physically sick, pretending to vomit, cut to vomit on the ground, "Oh look!" -> Picks up object with a logo/representation that promotes something

## How
### (Not yet determined)
Publishing targets (via GDrive? Headliner? ClickUp Zaps? Custom coded app? Whatever it is, AUTOMATIC publishing! Once proper assets are put into place, of course — scheduling option required.)

## What
All videos start with their 'reel' version — a short form summary. For those that want a deeper dive, they can keep watching/listening in their long-form formats.

Demos are published to Hacker News as well, with BTC integrations posted on Stacker News. Always keep in mind: Does the demo show something that is actually useful?
