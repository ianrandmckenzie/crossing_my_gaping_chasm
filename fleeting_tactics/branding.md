# Branding - Revolting Psycho

## Overall Themes and Values
(These bullet points still need to be categorized)

### Questions
* How do I make me & my message easier to digest?
* How do you encapsulate Revolting Day? Something like, ‘A daily rant about everyday life and topics backed by a vehement, rebellious decentralized ideological backing”
* How do I perform the preconceived 'psycho' that people will have in their heads while doing it authentically?
* If any of my original ideas have value, how do I remove attribution from myself?
  * "Do not give me credit or credence, do not centralize my message. Take my ideas and spread them as your own. Any of my original thoughts presented here are public domain"

### Requirements
* Remove speculation from your words unless you are an expert in the field of the topic being speculated on (and you acknowledge that it is speculation)
* Do not lend your voice liberally. Do it with intention (subject, credibility acknowledgement, audience): Social media, Personal interactions, Business interactions, Content marketing, Monetized content
* Make a simple life more attractive — Contrived enjoyment of anticipation and enjoyment of something can drive legitimate enjoyment of said thing.

### Reminders
* Beyond basic needs, value is generally a contrived mental construct
* An easy way to make the inauthentic performance genuine is by doing it as a joke, being silly
* Most humans are vulnerable and are underserved outside of a select few, there is an abundance of groups to serve

### Vows
Currently named "Open Faith Protocol"

(With the acknowledgement that it will take time and practice for full adherence)

* "I vow not to engage in heated debate with strangers. I will respond to insult-laden responses with ignorance of their insults, intentionally misinterpreted kindness from them, or authentic kindness from me. They are a campfire and I am a pond of water. Their projectile embers become inert in my waters. If I can make an enemy an ally, their cooled embers will one day enrich the soil I rest on, feeding the flora I mother."
  * More concisely: “I’m a pond, you’re fire. Spit your embers, I cool them and feed my mire.”
* "I vow to put ethics before financial stability/security"
* "I vow to prefer mediocrity over complacency"
* "I vow to pursue greatness for the betterment of a vulnerable, underserved group of humans over personal gain"
* "I vow to respond to negative actions and emotions with open ears, heart, hands and mind unless it enables immediate danger on myself or others"
* "I vow to object to others and perceived enemies with kindness, thoughtfulness, and pause to my immediate emotions"
* "I vow to listen to my body and tend to it as I would a vulnerable infant"
* "I vow to not be dogmatic with my vows"
* "I vow to be conservative with my pragmatism toward my vows"
* "I vow to recognize my participation of war/self-defence as legalized murder, even in the context of a justified defence of an objectively belligerent"
* "I vow not to label evil-doing people as evil. I vow to open my mind to the motive of their actions and identify the trauma, social injustice, misinformation, & other factors that led to the clouded/delusional thinking that led them to do evil"
* "I vow to analyze my judgmental thoughts toward evil-doers and identify how it reveals my privilege over them"
* "I vow to compliment those who unknowingly spread misinformation and calmly, kindly suggest starting point questions/thoughts that lead them to finding for themselves that the information is false."
#### Employee:
* "I vow to put human health, safety, decency, dignity, and stability over company policy"
* "I vow to put the health, safety, decency, dignity, and stability of me, my family, and my community (big or small) above my employers' business"
#### Employer:
* "I vow not to implement policies that put employees in a position of violating human decency, dignity, and stability"
* "I vow to implement an exit strategy from my company that transforms it into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)"
